## 1. Inroduction

## 2. General 

### 2.1 Description
It is nice to start your code or create a `README.md` file with a short description containing:

* name of the author/authors
* date of the creation
* project link with the ConLab affiliation
* general purpose of the script
* link to the github, where the latest version is stored
* licence

```
# This is code to replicate the analyses and figures from article [Abced, Hij 2019]
# 2019.03.08 J. Rscripter, M. Pythonscripter (HSE Linguistic Convergence Laboratory)

### 2.2 File names
File names should be meaningful. Avoid using special characters (Cyrillic, IPA) in file names --- stick with numbers, standard Latin letters, -, and _. Avoid using transliterated names (like `danniye_iz_Rikvani.txt`) or, if you ought to (like for word-specific files, e. g. sound name for one word), add English translation 

* bad: `2019.03.14_Adyghe_Neshukay_sp4_shha.wav`, 
* good: `2019.03.14_Adyghe_Neshukay_sp4_head_shha.wav`). 

If files should be run in a particular order, prefix them with numbers. If it seems likely youâ€™ll have more than 10 files, left pad with zero (`01.bla-bla...`, `02.bla-bla...`, ... `09.bla-bla...`, `10.bla-bla...`...). Pay attention to capitalization, since you, or some of your collaborators, might be using an operating system with a case-insensitive file system, so **never** use names that differ only in their capitalization.

### 2.3 Code
It is nice to limit your code to 80 characters per line. Long code lines are bad for readability. Also, many people prefer editor windows that are about 80 characters wide.

### 2.4 Comment your code


### 2.5 Tests
If you create a function or even package that will be used multiple times, it is nice to create tests for each function. It is even beter to write some tests before you start creating your function or package.

### 2.6 Warnings
If you create a function or even package it is better to incorporate some argument's check (e. g. Whether some argument is a number? What should the function do with missing values?) and create some meaningfull warning/error messages.

### 2.7 Examples
If you create a function or even package it is nice to write some text that describes every argument in all functions and all classes. It is also important to add some working examples that illustrate what youe functions do.

### 2.8 Citing
Don't forget to cite your data sources and software developers (Python, R, all package creaters). It is also nice to provide information about how to cite your work. If the result of our work is some `.html` page that represents data it is possible to use [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) for obtaining some DOI codes for any stuff that you put in the GitHub repository.

### 2.9 Versioning
Each important change to a function/package should be announced in `NEWS.md`. It is also to nice to have tracking of versions (have a look to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)).

## 3. Github Repos

## 4. DBs

## 5. Web applications

...

### 5.1 Platforms

If you consider to use your web application as a platform for other projects, you should provide a manual including:

- contacts of the platform developer

- the way you want users site your platform in projects

- a link to a repo containing template version of your application

- an instruction for data preparation and composition

- instruction or description of web interface contects to allow a user make changes in site desing in view of purposes of a project


## 6. Python

If you create scripts, applications or libraries using Python, you should provide comments in your code.
The best way do is to use docstrings which can be easily accessed with `<name>.__doc__`
You should describe every module, function, class and method (what is it for, how it works, why it is there).
For modules you also shoud provide list of variables and their description.
For classes you should provide list of variables, attributes and their description.
For functions and methods you should provide list of parameters and the output.

We provide the example in `documented_python.py` in this repo.

## 7. R
### 7.1 Libraries
List all libraries at the begining (don't use `require()` function):

```
library(tidyverse)
library(lingtypology)
```

Superheroes could also use `packageVersion()` function and report verssions of the packages.

```
library(tidyverse) # v. 1.2.1
library(lingtypology) # v. 1.0.13
```

Avoid importing packages as a whole, as this can cause name clashes between the imported packages. Instead, import only the specific functions you need.

### 7.2 `setwd()`
Be careful when using `setwd()`. Usage of the absolute path (like `"/Users/Alladin/Documents/sannic-project/files/"`) can limit reproducibility. It is the same about reading and writing files in a script (like `read.csv(file = "/Users/Alladin/Documents/sannic-project/files/dataset-2013-01.csv")`).

### 7.3 Temporary objects
For long codes it is a good practice to remove temporary objects after they have served their purpose. It will make it easear to debug the code.
