## Python

If you create scripts, applications or libraries using Python, you should provide comments in your code.
The best way do is to use docstrings which can be easily accessed with '<name>.__doc__'
You should describe every module, function, class and method (what is it for, how it works, why it is there).
For modules you also shoud provide list of variables and their description.
For classes you should provide list of variables, attributes and their description.
For functions and methods you should provide list of parameters and the output.

We provide the example in 'documented_python.py' in this repo.
